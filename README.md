Managed the state in my assignment project:
-------------------------------------------
1. After dynamically loading the data, I set the state inside to hold that data. 
2. When the courses are selected, I have declared a second state to keep the courses. 
3. After calculating the credit of the course, the total credit is declared as the third state and the reminder credit is declared as the fourth state and set to that state. 
4. The data that needs to be shown is inside the state. So I have passed the state variable to the cart component. Received the passed value as props from the cart component. 
5. Finally, I have dynamically placed the value where it is required to be shown.
